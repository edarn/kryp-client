UPDATED TODO LIST (Please clarify if i made a mistake):
1. Put a ====RJ11===== contact for the anemometer - make sure to have the correct pin layout. ;-)
2. Use RJ45 low profile "MX-95501-2881" for the other three connectors - with correct pin layot ;-p
3. Too small font in two places of the old pcb. JP4, JP5 and JP3 is where there is problem.
4. Detect if a sensor is connected or not. Windvane gives random output when not connected.
Could You send me once more a datasheet or something concerning how this windvane works? I will chech if this is possible.
TH: http://www.emesystems.com/OL2wind.htm#Anemometer is what I used along time ago. Also I got the following info a while back.

=============info from Davis=====
Our 7911s now ship with the vane already attached.
 
When the vane is pointing “straight ahead” (with the TAIL positioned ABOVE the support arm), it is oriented to display TRUE NORTH on our weather stations.
Wind direction is derived as a voltage on the wiper of a 20K pot.  There is a dead spot gap of 6 degrees (3 degrees on either side of due north, which is bridged by a 909K compensating resistor.)
The pinouts of the cable connector are still the same as they have always been.
We do not have any list of specs for all of our available sensors, because they are all primarily used exclusively on our own in-house weather stations.
Here is my complete spec sheet for our anemometers:
The output of our anemometer is all analog.  It is a series of pulses generated by the opening & closing of a magnetic read switch reacting to the turning of the windcups (a magnet lives inside the hub of the cups, offset from center).
The number of closures during each sampling period of 2.25 seconds gives you your miles per hour.
Wind direction is derived as a voltage on the wiper of a 20K pot.  There is a dead spot gap of 6 degrees (3 degrees on either side of due north, which is bridged by a 909K compensating resistor.)
Supply voltage is +2.5 volts on the yellow conductor.  (the following for std. version only).
Analog ground is on the red conductor.
Speed signal is on the black conductor.
Direction signal is on the green conductor.
Our windspeed readings are derived from the following formula:
Calibrated Wind Speed = Revolutions x 1600 / CAL.
In this formula, the number of REVOLUTIONS refers to the number of revolutions in every 2.25 second interval.
The ratio 1600/CAL is simply a way to convert units.  When the cal factor is 1600, the ratio becomes one, and the number of revolutions in 2.25 seconds becomes the windspeed in miles per hour.
A cal factor of 3578 yields meters per second.
A cal factor of 1843 yields knots per hour.
A cal factor of 995 yields kilometers per hour.

=====================



5. Move onboard i2c sensor so it gets fresh air and not affected by heat generated internally. Possible put it close to the Rj45 connector where the plastic box will be open.
TH: Maybe it is of no use to move it. It is already quite close to the sensor C. Not sure if it will do any good. 
9. Find me a suitable 0.5A powersupply (to use when not using the relay function). When I sell(?) the pcb as a weatherstation, then the Relay function is never used, so then I only need a small powersupply.
10 Possible move relays abit so it can be opened.
11. The symbol for the chipcap2 sensor may be abit wrong? There are holes drilled in the pcb in two places. Maybe it should only be silklayer symbols?

Sensor PCB
1. Make smaller if possible. NOT by using 4 layers and components on both side. If it is not possible, then keep same size.
2. Add other nice weathersensors if they support i2c. (Air pressure, Water temperature ...)
MS563702BA03-50 barometric sensor with I2C, You need me to find others? TH: No this sensor is ok.
3. There exists one Rain sensor which gives more pulses the more it rains. (it is just a switch that is closed more frequently the more it rains - similar as the wind speed sensor). It has a rj11 connector and the two center pins are only used. Are there any i2c counters that could be connected to it and mounted on the sensor pcb?)
You want to connect rain sensor to sensor PCB and then to main board?  TH: Yes
4. Connector at the same side as components.
5. Put RJ45 connector so that I can easily connect sensor with Mainboard with standard straight RJ45 cable.
6. Rainsensor should have RJ11 connector, but I have not received them yet. :-/ But I think I have seen somewhere that it is pin 2 and 3 that are only used.

I think this is all!
